This is a mod. Its main function is to modify Vivaldi's interface to make it more beautiful. 
The inspiration comes from opera GX. 
You can choose the corresponding version to use, if you donâ€™t know how to use it, you can refer to [here](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/guide-modding-vivaldi)
If you are using GX for 3.8.css, I hope you can use it with [this mod](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/58821/project-history-moon) on the forum.
If you have any questions, please reply me [here](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/guide-modding-vivaldi) on the forum, thank you
